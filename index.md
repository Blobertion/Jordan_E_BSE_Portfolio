# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was designing both the eletronics and the physical components of my maze. I realised that I wanted the interior of the maze to be more of the focus of the project, compared to the control scheme. Therefore I decided to add various components, such as magnets, that would change how players needed to move. They couldn't just focus on the aspect of moving the phone but also on how the maze was affecting the ball. In the same way, I realized that I wanted to have some interior parts of my maze move. I realized that the mini servos that had already been provided to move the maze itself could be very useful. I figured out the basic coding for the mini servos and linked them up to the ESP 32. Next week I hope to begin to construct the maze itself, considering that I now have some of the cardboard I need. 

```
// very basic sample code to move the servos
#include <ESP32Servo.h> 

Servo myservo;  // create servo object to control a servo
// twelve servo objects can be created on most boards

int pos = 0;    // variable to store the servo position

void setup() {
  myservo.attach(13);  // attaches the servo on pin 13 to the servo object
}

void loop() {
  for (pos = 0; pos <= 180; pos += 1) { // goes from 0 degrees to 180 degrees
    // in steps of 1 degree
    myservo.write(pos);              // tell servo to go to position in variable 'pos'
    delay(15);                       // waits 15ms for the servo to reach the position
  }
  for (pos = 180; pos >= 0; pos -= 1) { // goes from 180 degrees to 0 degrees
    myservo.write(pos);              // tell servo to go to position in variable 'pos'
    delay(15);                       // waits 15ms for the servo to reach the position
  }
}
```
